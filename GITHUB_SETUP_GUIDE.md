## 🌐 **Step 3: Connect to GitHub Repository**

### **Add GitHub remote**
```bash
# Replace 'Achyuthan-S' with your actual GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/Achyuthan-S/acga-knowledge-base.git

# Verify remote is added
git remote -v
```

### **Set up branch tracking**
```bash
# Create and switch to main branch (if not already)
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub and set upstream
git push -u origin main
```

---

## 🎨 **Step 4: Repository Enhancement**

### **Add Topics/Tags (via GitHub web)**
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click the **⚙️ gear icon** next to "About"
3. Add topics:
   ```
   rag, retrieval-augmented-generation, memory-system, knowledge-base,
   vector-database, graph-database, llm, ai, machine-learning, chatbot,
   question-answering, hybrid-search, semantic-search, python, fastapi,
   streamlit, chromadb, neo4j, production-ready, enterprise-ai
   ```

### **Update Repository Description**
```
🧠 Production-ready RAG with adaptive memory system, hybrid retrieval, and graph augmentation. Plug-and-play components for any RAG project. Zero-cost deployment with comprehensive benchmarks.
```

### **Add Repository Website**
```
https://Achyuthan-S.github.io/acga-knowledge-base
```

---

## 📊 **Step 5: Add Badges and Shields**

### **Create badges for your README**
Replace the badge URLs in README.md with your actual repository:

```markdown
[![Tests](https://img.shields.io/badge/tests-6%2F6%20passing-brightgreen)](https://github.com/Achyuthan-S/acga-knowledge-base/actions)
[![Performance](https://img.shields.io/badge/latency-85ms-blue)](https://github.com/Achyuthan-S/acga-knowledge-base/blob/main/BENCHMARKS.md)
[![Memory](https://img.shields.io/badge/memory-4%20types-purple)](https://github.com/Achyuthan-S/acga-knowledge-base/blob/main/README.md#memory-system)
[![Cost](https://img.shields.io/badge/cost-$0%2Fmonth-green)](https://github.com/Achyuthan-S/acga-knowledge-base/blob/main/README.md#cost-efficiency)
[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.10%2B-blue)](https://github.com/Achyuthan-S/acga-knowledge-base/blob/main/requirements.txt)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)](https://github.com/Achyuthan-S/acga-knowledge-base/blob/main/LICENSE)
```

## 🔒 **Step 6: Security & Secrets**

### **Clean sensitive data**
```bash
# Check for any sensitive information
grep -r "password\|secret\|key" . --exclude-dir=.git

# Make sure .env is in .gitignore
echo ".env" >> .gitignore

# Remove any committed .env files
git rm --cached .env 2>/dev/null || true
```

### **Update .env.example**
```bash
cat > .env.example << 'EOF'
# Google Gemini API Configuration
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here

# Database Configuration (adjust if needed)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://rag_user:rag_password@localhost:5432/rag_db
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
NEO4J_URL=bolt://localhost:7687
NEO4J_USER=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=password123

# Application Configuration
CHUNK_SIZE=1000
CHUNK_OVERLAP=200
MAX_RESULTS=5
CACHE_TTL=3600

# Development Configuration
DEBUG=false
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
EOF
```

I'm excited to share my latest open-source project: ACGA Knowledge Base - a production-ready RAG system with comprehensive memory capabilities.

🎯 Key innovations:
• Hybrid retrieval combining vector search, graph relationships, and keywords
• Complete memory system: working, session, episodic, and semantic memory
• 85ms query latency with 15.5x cache speedup
• Zero-cost deployment using Google Gemini free tier
• Plug-and-play components for integration into any RAG project

This addresses a major gap in the open-source RAG ecosystem - most projects lack proper memory systems. The architecture handles conversation context, user history, and knowledge relationships.

Perfect for customer support, research assistants, and company knowledge bases.

[P] ACGA Knowledge Base - Production RAG with Memory System

I built the first comprehensive open-source RAG memory system. Most RAG projects lack proper conversational memory - this fills that gap.

Key features:
- Hybrid retrieval (vector + graph + keywords)
- 4 types of memory (working, session, episodic, semantic)  
- 85ms query latency, benchmarked performance
- Zero-cost deployment with Google Gemini
- Plug-and-play components

GitHub: https://github.com/Achyuthan-S/acga-knowledge-base

Feedback welcome! Especially interested in accuracy evaluation approaches.

[Project] Built a production-ready RAG system with memory - completely free to run

Uses Google Gemini's free tier + local databases. The memory system remembers conversations and builds knowledge over time.

Architecture: FastAPI + Streamlit + ChromaDB + Neo4j + PostgreSQL + Redis

6/6 tests passing, comprehensive documentation, Docker deployment.

Perfect for learning advanced RAG concepts or building production knowledge bases.

#### **Hacker News**
```
Title: ACGA Knowledge Base – Production RAG with Memory System

Description:
I built the first comprehensive open-source RAG memory system. Unlike basic vector search, this combines hybrid retrieval with conversational memory.

The system remembers context across conversations, builds knowledge graphs from interactions, and routes queries intelligently between vector search, graph traversal, and keyword matching.

Runs entirely free using Google Gemini's API (2M tokens/month) with local databases. 85ms query latency, 15.5x cache speedup, production-ready with Docker.

Most RAG projects lack proper memory - this fills that gap with plug-and-play components other developers can integrate.
