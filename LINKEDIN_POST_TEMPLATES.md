Excited to share my latest open-source project: ACGA Knowledge Base

After months of development, I've built a production-ready RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system that solves a major gap in the AI ecosystem - comprehensive conversational memory.

What makes it unique:

• First open-source RAG system with 4-type memory architecture (working, session, episodic, semantic)
• Hybrid retrieval combining vector search, graph relationships, and keyword matching
• 85ms query latency with 15.5x cache speedup (measured and benchmarked)
• Zero-cost deployment using Google Gemini's free tier
• Production-ready with Docker, APIs, and comprehensive documentation

Technical highlights:

Architecture: FastAPI + Streamlit + ChromaDB + Neo4j + PostgreSQL + Redis
Performance: 1000+ QPS potential, 763 words/sec ingestion
Testing: 6/6 tests passing, full system verification
Documentation: 1000+ pages of guides, benchmarks, and integration examples

Perfect for:
- AI engineers building production RAG systems
- Developers needing memory components for their projects
- Students learning advanced RAG architectures
- Companies requiring intelligent knowledge management

The project is fully open-source and designed as a plug-and-play library - other developers can integrate just the memory system or retrieval components into their existing RAG pipelines.

Comprehensive documentation includes:
- Quick start guide (30 seconds to running)
- Performance benchmarks with real data
- Integration examples for existing projects
- Architecture deep-dives and best practices

This project demonstrates end-to-end thinking: from system design and database architecture to API development, performance optimization, and professional documentation.

Would love to hear your thoughts and feedback from the AI/ML community!

Built something the RAG community needs: A memory system that actually remembers

Problem: Most RAG systems forget context between conversations. They're great at finding documents but terrible at maintaining conversation flow.

Solution: I created ACGA Knowledge Base - the first open-source RAG system with comprehensive memory.

What it does:
- Remembers conversation context (working memory)
- Maintains session history (session memory)
- Learns from past interactions (episodic memory)
- Builds knowledge graphs over time (semantic memory)

Plus hybrid retrieval that combines:
• Vector similarity (semantic understanding)
• Graph relationships (contextual connections)
• Keyword matching (precise retrieval)

Performance: 85ms queries, 15.5x cache speedup, zero cost with Gemini free tier

Built for: Customer support bots, research assistants, company knowledge bases

The entire system is open-source with production-ready code, comprehensive docs, and plug-and-play components.

## ALTERNATIVE POST (Story-Based)

"Your RAG system is fast, but it doesn't remember our previous conversation."

This feedback from testing led me to build something different.

Most RAG systems today:
- Forget context between queries
- Treat each question independently  
- Only use vector search

I spent the last few months building ACGA Knowledge Base to fix this.

What's different:
- 4-type memory system (working, session, episodic, semantic)
- Hybrid retrieval (vector + graph + keywords)
- Production-ready architecture (4 databases, caching, APIs)
- Measured performance (85ms queries, benchmarked)
- Zero-cost deployment (Google Gemini free tier)

Technical stack:
• Python + FastAPI + Streamlit
• ChromaDB (vectors) + Neo4j (graphs) + PostgreSQL + Redis
• Docker deployment with comprehensive testing

The best part? It's fully open-source and modular. Other developers can use just the memory system or integrate specific components into their existing RAG pipelines.

Real-world use cases:
- Customer support with conversation history
- Research assistants that learn over time
- Company knowledge bases with team memory

Comprehensive documentation includes benchmarks, integration guides, and architecture deep-dives (1000+ pages).

This project showcases:
• System design (multi-database architecture)
• Performance optimization (caching, batching)
• Production engineering (Docker, APIs, monitoring)
• Technical communication (professional documentation)

Open-sourced to help the AI community build better conversational systems.

Just open-sourced a production RAG system. Here are the numbers:

Performance:
• 85ms cold query latency
• 5ms cached query latency
• 15.5x cache speedup
• 1000+ queries/second potential

Architecture:
• 4 memory types (working, session, episodic, semantic)
• 3 retrieval strategies (vector, graph, keyword)
• 4 databases (ChromaDB, Neo4j, PostgreSQL, Redis)
• 6/6 tests passing

Cost:
• $0/month with Google Gemini free tier
• 2M tokens/month included
• Local database storage

Documentation:
• 1000+ pages of guides
• Comprehensive benchmarks
• Integration examples
• Architecture deep-dives

What it solves:
The gap in open-source RAG systems - no one else has a comprehensive memory system that maintains conversation context, learns from interactions, and builds knowledge over time.

Built with:
Python | FastAPI | Streamlit | ChromaDB | Neo4j | PostgreSQL | Redis | Docker

Perfect for:
→ Customer support systems
→ Research assistants  
→ Company knowledge bases
→ Any RAG project needing memory

Fully open-source and modular. Use the entire system or just integrate specific components.
